## Setup Instructions

### Backend
1. Clone the repository and navigate to `jobportal-backend`.
2. Configure DB in `application.properties`.
3. Build and run:
```bash
./mvnw clean install
./mvnw spring-boot:run


### Frontend 
1. Clone the repository and keep in mind that we have integrated two seprate projects into one projects i.e. the angular library project and the parent project.
2. Thus we need to separately start both one by one .
3. navigate to the job-portal
4. Build and run 

```bash

ng build jobs-portal-lib --watch
npm install
ng serve
